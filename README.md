# fsuae-3.1.66

My additions to the quest of 'the perfect amiga emulation' at least from my point of view to FS-UAE.

Orginally back in the early 2000's I added some functionality to WinUAE to;
Host -> WinUAE & WinUAE -> Host, clipboard 'text' only copying.
WinUAE -> Could execute windoze applications.

Now I'm bring those functionalities back all be it under linux.
